# Unfair Inequality in Education: A Benchmark for AI-Fairness Research

This is the repository for the code and dataset of the paper intitled "Unfair Inequality in Education: A Benchmark for AI-Fairness Research" submitted to the DEMO track of the 27TH European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI).

## Abstract

This paper proposes a novel benchmark specifically designed for AI fairness research in education.
It can be used for challenging tasks aimed at improving students' performance and reducing dropout rates which are also discussed in the paper to emphasize significant research directions.
By prioritizing fairness,  this benchmark aims to foster the development of bias-free AI solutions, promoting equal educational access and outcomes for all students.
