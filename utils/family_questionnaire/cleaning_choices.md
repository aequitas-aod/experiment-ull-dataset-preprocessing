- _f12a_ and _f12b_: aggregated into a new column "_see_adult_read_"
  - a average operation applied
- _f14a_ -> _f14c_: aggregated into a new column "_visit_in_school_by_people_"
  - a average operation applied
- _f15a_ -> _f15f_: aggregated into a new column "_interest_in_interview_"
  - to calculate this column, the average of values regarding the family's interest in various aspects was taken.
- _f16a_ -> _f16f_: aggregated into a new column "_support_at_home_"
